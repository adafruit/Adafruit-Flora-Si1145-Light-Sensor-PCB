Your wearable can now keep you from getting sunburnt, with the Flora digital UV index sensor. We took our popular SI1145 UV index sensor and cut out everything you don't need for using with our wearable platforms: Flora and Gemma M0. It's small, round, and connects to the I2C bus pads. Flora and Gemma M0 can even use our library code to get calibrated light level and UV index data from the sensor.

Please note: this sensor can be used by <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/659">Flora</a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501">Gemma M0</a> but is too complex for <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1222">Gemma v2 (ATtiny85)</a>!
